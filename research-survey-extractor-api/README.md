       within this [directory](src/main/resources)
    3. Refer this [template](src/main/resources/secrets.properties.template) and configure database login credential and
       jwt related security configurations within file created from above step
3. Clone this project
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and change directory to the `research-survey-extractor-api` directory

```agsl
cd research-survey-extractor-api
```

5. Now build the project
    1. By running below command if you're on a windows based system
   ```agsl
   ./gradlew.bat build
    ```
    2. Else run below command if you're on an unix based system
   ```agsl

   ```
6. Run the springboot application using below command:

```agsl
java -jar build/libs/research-survey-extractor-api-1.0.jar

pattern that is present on relative path: `build/libs`

7. Once the server is up, then you shall find a message similar to this:

```agsl
